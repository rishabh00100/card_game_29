# card_game_29

## Coding my all time favourite card game "29" on python
The reason I picked up this project:
1. It involved various stages like bidding, playing, score counting
2. It gives me opportunity to gain command on concepts like object oriented programming, recursion, nested classes

This is still WIP

Status: Completed the code for bidding stage. Code for gameplay in progress

Rules of the game:
