# card_game_29

## Coding my all time favourite card game "29" on python
The reason I picked up this project:
1. It involved various complex stages like bidding, playing, score counting which gives me oppotunity to explore different approaches to execute complex logics
2. It gives me opportunity to gain command on concepts like object oriented programming, recursion, nested classes, inheritance

## Learnings from this project:
1. Extensive use of OOPs to create instances of cards, players, bidding rounds, playing rounds
2. Wanted to execute a quick GUI implementation for this game as my main goal is to focus on training the AI. I tried to use Unity and Kivy, but these tools are require significant learning curve and was not aligned to my goals for this project. So, I decided to create the GUI using OpenCV

## Rules of the game:

## TODOs:
- [x] Bidding stage
- [x] Playing stage
- [x] Command Line Based UI
- [x] Add GUI to the game
- [ ] Make Shuffling more humanistic instead of using random functions
- [ ] Pass on used decks to start next match rounds
- [ ] Train RNN models in unsupervised manner to eventually be used as an AI player for this game itself

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a conda env and install all the dependencies using the environment.yml file

## Start Playing the game:
1. Navigate to the root of the repo using terminal
2. Run `python3 Module.py`
