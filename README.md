# card_game_29

## Coding my all time favourite card game "29" on python
The reason I picked up this project:
1. It involved various stages like bidding, playing, score counting
2. It gives me opportunity to gain command on concepts like object oriented programming, recursion, nested classes, inheritance

This is still WIP.

Status: Coding for gameplay is complete

Rules of the game:

TODOs:
1. Add UI to the game
2. Make Shuffling more humanistic instead of using random functions
3. Pass on used decks to start next match rounds
4. Train RNN models in unsupervised manner to eventually be used as an AI player for this game itself
